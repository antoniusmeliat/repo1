We will look at both the inside and outside of your home (such as gardens and sheds) and take some photographs. This means that we have a record of any special features such as adaptations. Customers are responsible for reporting any repairs or improvements that are needed in their homes.

We will make sure our information on you and who lives with you is up to date, including any emergency contact information, and we will ask to see your identification which we will photograph. If this I.D. doesn’t have a photograph on it, we may use this opportunity to take a photo of you as well for future reference.

We will also chat to you about services that we or others may offer, which may be relevant to your circumstances, such as practical or financial help. 

We will ask you if you would like to be more involved in helping shape the future of Red Kite.

We will make sure you have an opportunity to ask us any questions you may have about your tenancy and circumstances as well.
